# Back up and restore

Back up and restore applications on SRO (Stakater Red Hat OpenShift)

For production clusters, regular maintenance should include routine backup operations on a regular basis to ensure data integrity and reduce the risk of data loss due to unexpected events. Back up operations should include the cluster state, application state, and the running configuration of both stateless and stateful applications in the cluster.

# Velero

As a production-ready solution, SRO provides the Velero addon by default, to support backup and restore operations for your SRO cluster and persistent volumes.

# Regular backup operations

For production clusters, you should be familiar with the following basic administrative functions Velero provides:

- Set a backup schedules
- Fetch backup archives
- Run on-demand backups
- Restore from a backup archive
